To start a problem:

- Copy the `template` folder and rename to the day (e.g. `01`)
- Add a `sample.txt` file to the `input` and `output` directories
- Running `python main.py` in the directory should run a unit test
- Complete the `solve` function
- Add in the `input.txt` file for the problem, and capture the solved output somehow
